This project will look into Jade, a templating engine originally developed for the Node.js platform. It will involve developing
a blog as a use case, using templates for individual posts and the blog as a whole. As a blog has overlapping CSS classes
between its main page (with several blog posts) and individual posts, this chapter will demonstrate the importance of using a
CSS pre-processor to simplify one's styling.

This project will also emphasize the importance of compression, minification and obfuscation in developing a high-traffic blog
as a use case.

Jade supports layouts, mixins, and embeded JavaScript. Using Jade, developers can now iterate with massive amounts of HTML
templates without having to worry about overlapping code and flexibility.

SASS is a cascading style sheet preprocessor; it is used to scaffold, minify and enhance the flexibility of the CSS workflow. Sass
supports mixins and modularization out of the box. Sass allows developers to split up large CSS files into smaller, more modular
files (partials), adding flexibility allowing you to keep your code DRY.
